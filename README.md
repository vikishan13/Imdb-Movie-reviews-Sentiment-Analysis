# Imdb-Movie-reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using TensorFlow and the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

Requirements
Make sure to have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

TensorFlow (version 2.15.0)
TensorFlow Datasets (tensorflow-datasets)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The IMDb movie reviews dataset is utilized for training and testing the sentiment analysis model. TensorFlow Datasets (tfds) is employed to load and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Data Preprocessing
Text data is processed through tokenization and sequence conversion using the Tokenizer class from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text. Tokenization involves breaking down sentences into individual words, and sequences are generated to represent the order of these words. Padding is applied to ensure uniform sequence lengths. The tokenizer is trained on the training set, and the same tokenizer is used to process the test set.

Model Architecture
The sentiment analysis model consists of an embedding layer, a flatten layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final dense layer with sigmoid activation. The embedding layer is crucial for converting words into dense vectors, allowing the model to capture semantic relationships between words.

Model Compilation and Training
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. Training is performed on the training set, with validation on the test set. Evaluate the model's performance and consider adjusting hyperparameters to mitigate overfitting.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test set, and analyze accuracy metrics to assess performance. Consider using additional techniques like early stopping and hyperparameter tuning for further improvement.

Prediction
The trained model can be used to make predictions on new text data. Provide input text, tokenize it using the trained tokenizer, and obtain predictions using the trained model.

Results
The model achieves a commendable accuracy on the test set, but slight overfitting may be observed. Consider implementing regularization techniques or adjusting model architecture for further enhancement.
